# How to Download and Install Paro International Airport for FS2004
 
Paro International Airport (IATA: PBH, ICAO: VQPR) is the only international airport in Bhutan, a mountainous kingdom in the eastern Himalayas. The airport is located in a deep valley on the bank of the Paro river, at an elevation of 7,300 ft (2,200 m). It has a single runway of 6,445 feet (1,964 m) in length, and is considered one of the most challenging airports in the world for landing and takeoff. Only a few pilots are certified to fly to Paro, and they have to navigate through steep mountains and strong winds. The airport is served by Druk Air, the Royal Bhutan Airlines, which operates flights to several destinations in Asia.
